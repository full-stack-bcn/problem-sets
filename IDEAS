- A simple page showing an image carousel using a free image API

  (+ fade-in/fade-out animation).

Not-so-simple examples of Redux

- Paginator:
  - Redux state is the list of entities shown, plus loading state.
    (number of pages, etc are selectors).
  - The API is called in pages, using thunk, and either on clicking a "more"
    button or just on render.

- Search Engine:
  - The search term and any changes to it are managed in Redux,
    plus loading state. There is debouncing of API calls to search.
