# Mini-projects

1. Write a function that receives an integer N and returns the spelling of N
   in English (or Spanish, or Catalan). Examples

   ```
   say(19) => "nineteen"
   say(42) => "Forty-two"
   say(100) => "One hundred"
   say(467889) => "Four hundred sixty-seven thousand eight hundred eighty-nine"
   ```

2. Write a "scheduler". A scheduler is given a list of tasks, where each task
   is described by a name, the number of hours to complete, and the tasks it
   depends on (which are to be completed first). Given the number of work hours
   in a day, the scheduler will output the tasks (or parts of tasks) in order
   for each day, also showing the total number of days the whole project will
   take.

3. Write a program that finds all folders called `node_modules` which are not
   inside a `node_modules` folder themselves and erases them all from disk.
